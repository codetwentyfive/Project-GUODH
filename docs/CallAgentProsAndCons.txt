✦ Consider a Hybrid Solution
  • Start with a service like Twilio for the MVP phase
  • Build your own system gradually while the service proves itself
  • Focus initially on the unique value propositions (AI conversation, mood analysis)
  • Migrate to your own system once you have stable revenue and user base

✦ Recommended Development Phases
  • MVP Phase: Use Twilio or a similar service to quickly validate the concept
  • Growth Phase: Begin developing your own Asterisk-based system
  • Scale Phase: Gradually migrate to your custom solution

✦ Benefits of This Approach
  • Get to market faster
  • Validate the business model
  • Learn from real user feedback
  • Build the custom system with real-world requirements
  • Minimize initial technical risk
