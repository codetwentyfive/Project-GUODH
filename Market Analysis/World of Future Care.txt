While financial services leads global market size through banking, insurance and investments, other major sectors including 
technology, healthcare, energy and agriculture each play crucial roles in the global economy. 
But the combined value of financial services and technology likely represents the largest share due to their deep integration across 
all other sectors and modern economies.
Got their mittens everywhere

But.... in my butt, I think that healthcare will experience super large(at least very large) growth in that sector in the future, as the world is getting older and older, and the number of people with dementia is increasing. 
Which is good for business, but bad for the world.but also great puplicity... but hey ,thats the weird world we live in.
In the end we are developing nothing less than a device that answers the wishes of the patient and helps the few professional workers left in the field to deal with their workload more effectivly and give better care,
Many ears and many little helpers seeing to it that the patients are kept happy and in a good mood.
Socialized and entertained, we are almost competing with the A.I of the future.

Maybe thats too broad of a statement.
I also inhaled some weed as iam writing this, so iam not sure if iam making sense.
