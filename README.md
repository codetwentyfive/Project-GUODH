Where to download: 
https://www.asterisk.org/downloads/asterisk/all-asterisk-versions/
Currently we will be targeting the LTS 20.X version

I  needed these dependenccies on a relatively new ubuntu `sudo apt install libedit-dev uuid-dev libjansson-dev libxml2-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev`

After downloading (If on linux) use `tar zxvf <package name>.tar.gz` to unpack package

Once you have unpacked project cd into project and run `./configure` (Make sure to have installed above dependencies before this point)
