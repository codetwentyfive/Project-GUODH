Project Setup and Planning Document

1. Project Overview:
- Project Name: [Insert Name]
- End Goal:
  -Develop an app/device to engage dementia patients with features like prerecorded messages from loved ones, evolving to AI-driven voice bots for conversation and companionship. 
  This reduces loneliness and supports care staff by automating some interactions.
  - Assess patient mood via tone or patterns and extract key needs/preferences for tailored care.
  Our ultimate goal is to revolutionize modern caregiving by providing an innovative companion app designed to enhance care services, foster connection, and streamline operations 
  in care facilities.

2. Project Scope:
- The target audience includes dementia patients, their caregivers, and care facility staff. The primary problem addressed is the lack of consistent emotional support and
 personalized interaction for dementia patients, leading to loneliness and further physical and mental decline as studies show (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3874845/)
 For caregivers and staff, the app aims to alleviate the workload by automating routine interactions and providing actionable insights into patient mood and needs.
- Key features of the final product:
  1. Personalized prerecorded messages from loved ones to offer comfort and familiarity.
  2. AI-driven voice bot made from the (audio of loved ones ) capable of holding meaningful conversations to reduce loneliness.
  3. Real-time mood assessment and needs analysis using tone recognition to provide actionable insights for caregivers.

3. Technology Stack:
- Frontend: [React/Next.js, Angular, etc.]
- Backend: [Node.js, Django, etc.]
- Database: [PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.]
- Other Tools: [Auth0, Firebase, etc.]
- Hosting/Deployment: [Vercel, AWS, Netlify, etc.]

4. MVP Definition:
- Core features required to validate the idea:
  1. A call to the patients number with a simple playback of prerecorded messages from loved ones to create familiarity and comfort.
  2. Basic AI-driven responses using a limited set of prerecorded phrases to simulate conversation.
  3. Real-time voice tone analysis to determine mood and send simple notifications to caregivers.
- Exclude non-essential features for faster delivery and testing.

5. Milestones:
- Milestone 1: Research and planning (1-2 weeks)
- Milestone 2: MVP development (4-6 weeks)
- Milestone 3: Testing and iteration (2 weeks)
- Milestone 4: Full product development and deployment (8-12 weeks)

6. Estimated Workload:
- Identify key tasks for each milestone.
- Break down tasks into manageable chunks.
- Assign timelines for each chunk.

7. Finished Product:
- Detailed requirements for the final version:
  - User experience: Intuitive, accessible design.
  - Functionality: Covers all planned features and supports scalability.
  - Deployment: Fully operational and accessible via [URL/app store].

8. Next Steps:
1. Finalize the technology stack based on the project goals.
2. Identify team members or resources needed.
3. Begin wireframing or prototyping the MVP.
4. Set up a project management tool (e.g., Trello, Asana) for tracking progress.

9. Notes and Risks:
- Identify potential risks and challenges.
- Consider fallback solutions.

10. Review and Feedback:
- Regularly review the progress.
- Iterate on the MVP based on feedback.
